## Dataset Description

The UCI Student Performance Dataset contains student information related to academic performance in secondary education. It includes demographic, social, school-related, and academic variables. The main target variable for this project is **G3**, which represents the student's final grade.

## Target Variable

**G3 — Final grade**
The value of G3 ranges from 0 to 20.

## Machine Learning Task Types

This dataset is appropriate for both regression and classification.
For **regression**, the model can predict the numerical final grade, G3.
For **classification**, the G3 variable can be converted into categories, such as:
- Pass / Fail
- Low / Medium / High performance
- At-risk / Not at-risk

## Reason for Selection

This dataset is a strong choice for the project because it is public, structured, and small enough for classroom use in Google Colab. It supports both regression and classification, which allows students to compare different machine learning algorithms using the same dataset. 

The dataset is also appropriate for studying educational questions, such as which student-related factors are associated with academic success and which machine learning algorithm performs best for predicting student performance.

One important modeling issue is that **G1** and **G2** are strongly related to **G3**. These variables may create target leakage if the goal is early prediction before final grades are known. Therefore, the project can compare a full information model with an early-warning model.
